<font face="Arial" size="2">The e-Business Framework Wizard uses LANSA for the Web functions. You do not require user profiles or passwords to execute these functions unless you have set up a higher level of security for your Web system. You may wish to add process level authentication to limit user access to the Wizard.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">The security rules as described in the <i>Installing LANSA on Windows </i>and the<i> Installing LANSA on iSeries g</i>uides apply to the Wizard processes and functions. If you do not have security defined for your LANSA for the Web system, you may wish to set up process level authentication so that you have controlled access to the Wizard</font><br><font face="Arial" size="2">To set up process level authentication, refer to the<i> Installing LANSA on Windows Guide.</i> <br>You will want to secure this process:</font><br><table width="100%"><tr valign="TOP"><td width="9%">&nbsp;</td><td><font face="Courier New" size="2"><b>    &nbsp;WIZARD2</b></font></td></tr></table><hr noshade><font face="Arial" size="2">You can also use task tracking with the Wizard. If you have task tracking enabled, refer to <a href="ww2_025.htm">Task Tracking</a>.</font><br><hr noshade><font face="Arial" size="2">When you execute the Wizard, you will be creating LANSA for the Web graphic variables which use LANSA system variables. The owner of these system variables is based on the user profile used when executing the Wizard. If you wish to edit these system variables using the LANSA for the Web Editor, you must have authority to these variables. The owner may grant authority to the system variables. If you execute the LANSA for the Web Editor using the owner's profile, you may change these variables. The LANSA for the Web PC-based utilities are secured by user profile and password.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If Web Server authentication has been set up, then you will enter a profile and password, and you should be able to determine the user profile being used to create the system variables. If no authentication has been configured, then anonymous user access is being used. You must determine the profile associated with the DFTUSR. For more details about user profile security, refer to the <i>Installing LANSA on Windows Guide.</i></font><br>
