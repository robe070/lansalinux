<font face="Arial" size="3"><i><b>Existing LANSA for the Web System earlier than V10.0</b></i></font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have LANSA Web Applications with an interface generated by the e-Business Framework Wizard before Version 10.0, changes made with the e-Business Framework Wizard will have some impact on your existing functions.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">The e-Business Framework Wizard V10.0 includes new layout schemas and has modified the menu build process significantly.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have a pre V10.0 Web Application built using the Wizard and want to make minor changes to the presentation interface, continue to use the e-Business Framework Wizard V9.0 or V9.1.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have a pre V10.0 Web Application built using the Wizard and want to overhaul the interface, consider using the e-Business Framework Wizard V10.0 for a new "look-and-feel" for your Web Application. In this case, existing menus will be automatically converted to the Wizard V10.0 format but may need to be reviewed to select new button styles and so on. Menus must then be rebuilt. If you rebuild your menus using the e-Business Framework Wizard, you must also rebuild your Layout, and vice versa. For more details, refer to <a href="5a5868a.htm">Converting a Web Application from Wizard V9.1 to V10.0</a>.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Once you run the Wizard V10.0 over your application, you will no longer be able to view all the menu definitions in Wizard V9.0 or V9.1, if you choose to revert to that version of the software.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Most of the graphic variables used in the Wizard V9.0 and V9.1 are also used in the Wizard V10.0.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="3"><i><b>Existing LANSA for the Web System earlier than V8.0 -EPC538</b></i></font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have LANSA Web applications created before Release 8.0 and EPC538 were installed, changes made with the e-Business Framework Wizard will have some impact on your existing functions.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Graphic variable changes made using the e-Business Framework Wizard will immediately impact your existing applications without any recompilation. The Wizard simply provides an alternate interface for changing the graphic variables you have used in your functions. Any changes made to specific browse list variables, process specific variables or system wide variables will immediately impact your Web functions.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Menu component and presentation layout changes made using the e-Business Framework Wizard will only impact functions which are compiled or recompiled after the LANSA for the Web system was upgraded for the e-Business Framework Wizard. The HTML pages for your functions must include a new set of RDML tags such as &lt;RDML LAYOUT&gt; in order to use the Wizard changes. These tags will not exist in your older functions until they have been recompiled.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">When you recompile an older function, it may be updated to use the new layouts and components if you have specified process specific or system wide default layout changes.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If you are recompiling existing functions in a partition using the Wizard and you do not wish to have the Wizard change the presentation layout (colors, menu components, etc.) of your existing function, then you have several options:</font><br><ol><li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do not create any system wide default layouts. The RDML LAYOUT tags are still used in your HTML pages when recompiled, but no components will have been defined. Your existing functions will continue to execute without change.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">Do not create any process specific layouts for a process which already exists, i.e., do not create a layout for the process unless you want it to adopt the new layouts.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you have created system wide default layouts but do not want them to impact specific processes, then you can create a process specific Web skeleton which does not include the RDML LAYOUT and other new RDML tags. For more technical details, refer to <A HREF="ww4_065.HTM">Customizing a Presentation Layout – Technically Speaking</A>.</font></li></ol><font face="Arial" size="2">When you import any functions into your system, you should be aware of these points so that you can properly handle the impact of the Wizard on your application.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">On iSeries, If you have created your own skeletons in file DC@W22 and you wish to use the e-Business Framework Wizard for these existing functions, you may need to modify your skeletons according to the changes made in the default shipped skeleton (WEBSKEL in file DC@F28 in the LANSA data library).</font><br>
