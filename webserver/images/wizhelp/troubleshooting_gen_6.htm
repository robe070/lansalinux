<font face="Arial" size="2">When you execute your Web application, you are receiving an error saying that an image cannot be found. When you check the e-Business Framework Wizard, the relating image file name is blank. It appears as if no file has been specified. </font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">For example, in your finished application the Company Logo image cannot be found.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="3"><i><b>Solution</b></i></font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">View your HTML source from the browser to see what file name is being used. If no file name has been specified, then a blank file name has been specified in the Wizard. You must enter a valid file name.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">If an image has been entered, check that the image exists in the image location configured for LANSA for the Web server. Use the Image button to verify the Image exists. </font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">This situation also occurs when you specify a file name for an image and then change the field to blanks. Once a name has been specified, the graphic variable is created. If you change the file name to blank, it does not delete the variable but stores the blank value. If you do not want the process specific image used, you must manually delete the associated graphic variable using the LANSA for the Web Editor.</font><br>
