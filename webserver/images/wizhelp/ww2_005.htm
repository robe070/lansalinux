<font face="Arial" size="2">The e-Business Framework Wizard is a browser-based tool used to customize the presentation of your LANSA Web applications. It is an automated alternative to using the PC-based LANSA Web utilities to modify the presentation variables and components. The Wizard is made up of LANSA processes and functions in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript components.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">The e-Business Framework Wizard allows you to:</font><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Define the boundaries of the application you want to customize.<br><br>It allows you to select a generic subset of processes to work with within the Wizard. The process drop down on the Home Page is modified to reflect your selection.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Change the layout of your application.<br><br>A selection of layout templates provided can be used to define the background of your Web application. You can change the layout style associated with a process by selecting from the schemas available with the Wizard. In addition, you can nominate the color scheme, the type and style of menus to be included and whether a banner, logo or click tracking should be incorporated in the interface.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Customize Menu components.<br><br>The Wizard allows you to create Left, Right and Horizontal Menu components. DHTML and Standard Menus (buttons, hypertext, images) are supported. Each Menu Component may consist of many different menu items, which can be used to link the various functions or URL references.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Define Style sheets.<br><br>The Wizard allows you to create a style sheet at a process level. Tags, Classes, Ids and Sub Classes can be built using a supported selection of font attributes. Additional details can be entered using the free-format text area. </font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Change the presentation of your LANSA browse lists. <br><br>Using the Wizard, you do not need to know the exact name of the graphic variable of the associated browse list attribute you want to change. All attributes of a browse list are presented to you in a single screen so that you can quickly and easily identify what you want to change. </font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Save changes in multiple languages.<br><br>The Wizard allows you to specify the language code used to save your customizations. This may be different to the language used to run the Wizard. Every time the Wizard is started, the language code is defaulted to the current language.</font><br><br><font face="Arial" size="2">Change or Delete LANSA graphic variables.<br><br>For example, if you wanted to change the value of the graphic variable used to define the company logo, you would have to change the *LW3CPYLOGO variable using the PC-based LANSA for the Web Editor. In the e-Business Framework Wizard, the variable is described using a sentence-like and easy-to-understand description. You simply set the Company Logo option and then preview the image.</font><br><br>
