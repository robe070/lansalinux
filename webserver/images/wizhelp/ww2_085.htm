<font face="Arial" size="4"><b>Considerations for Using the Wizard</b></font><br clear="ALL"><hr size="4">
<font face="Arial" size="2">Following are some important considerations when using the e-Business Framework Wizard:</font><br><ul><li><font face="Arial" size="2">The e-Business Framework Wizard V9.1 and V10.0 can be run concurrently in a LANSA partition.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Wizard must be installed into each partition in which you plan to develop with the Wizard. It does not have to be installed into a partition used only for executing finished LANSA for the Web applications.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">Graphic variable changes made using the e-Business Framework Wizard will immediately impact your applications. Menu component and presentation layout changes made using the e-Business Framework Wizard will only impact functions which were compiled after the LANSA for the Web system was upgraded for the e-Business Framework Wizard. For more details, refer to <a href="ww2_092.htm">Existing LANSA for the Web System earlier than V8.0</a>.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">If task tracking is enabled in your partition, you will need to use the TASK_ID parameter when running the Wizard.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Wizard uses WEBEVENT functions. If you are using the Back key, be sure to check your Browser Configuration.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">You may wish to add process level authentication to provide secured access to the Wizard. </font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Wizard has been designed for use with WEBEVENT functions. The Wizard can also be used with procedural functions but you must be very careful with menu components.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">It has been designed as a multilingual application with English as the default language.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">All images shipped with the Wizard exclude text and, as such, can be used by all languages in multilingual applications.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">Before changing the System Wide Default Layouts, be sure that you have read the <a href="ww2_090.htm">Impact on Existing Applications</a>.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">It is very important to understand the impact of the changes made by the Wizard. For more details, refer to <a href="ww2_090.htm">Impact on Existing Applications</a>.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">If you wish to move your application to a new partition or a new LANSA system, you must understand how the Wizard impacts your system. For more details, refer to <A HREF="wwa_001.htm">Application Import/Export</A>.</font></li><li><font face="Arial" size="2">Extended browse list support must be turned on in the partition where you are running the e-Business Framework Wizard.</font></li></ul>
