LANSA Linux Runtime Image

This is a repository for distributing Linux runtime images of LANSA.

The initial intention is to use it to instantiate WAM instances in AWS.

The code in the repo is currently not supported. It has no warranty of any kind and should only be used by LANSA to develop this new feature.
